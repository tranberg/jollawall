Instantly create ambiance wallpapers for your Jolla.


Having spent some time in Gimp creating ambiance wallpapers for my Jolla I thought it would be nice to have a fast and easy tool for doing so. I soon found [Croppic](https://github.com/styoe/croppic), a jQuery plugin for cropping pictures, and then JollaWall was created.


My original inspiration comes from [this site](http://www.jollausers.com/2013/12/how-to-make-ambiance-wallpapers-for-sailfish-bonus/), which explains why the dimensions of the image should be 540x1600 pixels.

This is a beta version, that functions somewhat satisfactory. This repository is not linked to Croppic, so it's just a snapshot, that wont receive updates. I chose to do this because I have made some alterations.
